# Coursera Machine Learning 

This course is much more theoretical than the Udemy Course. The lessons also go deeper into the math than the Udemy Course, which focuses more on the coding side of things.
Although, it covers roughly the same materials as the Udemy, the projects in this
course have fewer guidance, hence a lot of difficult.

Nevertheless, this course did prepare me to do a more rigorous machine learning projects. It also primes me well when i started reading Machine Learning research papers.
